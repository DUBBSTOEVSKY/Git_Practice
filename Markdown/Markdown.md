## Usage

You can open the `README.md` file in any Markdown editor to view the formatted text. Here are some key features of Markdown:

- **Headers**: Use `#` for headers.
- **Emphasis**: Use `*` or `_` for italic and `**` or `__` for bold.
- **Lists**: Use `-`, `+`, or `*` for unordered lists, and numbers for ordered lists.
- **Code Blocks**: Use backticks (\`) for inline code and triple backticks for code blocks.

### Example

# Header 1
## Header 2

**Bold** or __Bold__
